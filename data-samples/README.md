Data samples to test `std-dev` against. The names start with the function fitting to the data.

# Usage

`cat <file in this directory> | std-dev regression <other args>`

# Data origin

The data is either generated by me, test data gathered by me, or taken from a source (as listed below).

-   `heavy` - a submodule filled with data samples containing several thousand or million samples.
    Run `git submodule init --update --recursive` if the directory isn't found.

    To not process all the samples, pipe them through `head -n1000` to get the first 1000 samples.
